            <div class="container">
                <h2>Our Begining</h2>
                <p>On Saturday, August 18, 1873, the nine founding members of the Los Angeles County Beekeepers
                    Association
                    held its first meeting in El Monte, California. A Constitution and By-Laws were adopted and the
                    following officers were elected: President: John T. Gordon, Vice-Presidents: Thomas A. Garvey and W.
                    T.
                    Martin, Secretary: William M. Rasmussen, Treasurer: J.C. Bames. Members: Henry Beekley, L.M.
                    Rasmussen,
                    Levi Richardson, and A.J. Davidson were in attendance. The Los Angeles County Beekeepers Association
                    has
                    met continuously since then. When Robert's Rules of Order were published in 1876 as a "guide to fair
                    and
                    orderly procedures in meetings" they were adopted by the LACBA.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p> To promote the interest of bee culture and beekeeping within Los Angeles County.</p>

                <p>To enhance the education of the general public and of the association members concerning the
                    important
                    roles of honeybees in the natural, rural, and urban worlds.</p>

                <p>To provide information for the closer cooperation of beekeepers with apiculture researchers and
                    public
                    agencies that they may work together for the promotion of systematic, managed beekeeping in the
                    County
                    of Los Angeles.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Our Comunity</h2>
                <p>We are a diverse community populated by individuals from all walks of life. We are brought together
                    by our interest in and love of the honeybee. We're composed of bee hobbyists, bee enthusiasts, small
                    scale beekeepers, and commercial beekeepers who make our living from working with bees. Whether a
                    new bee or a long time beekeeper we share our experience and knowledge with each other and the
                    general public. Our members unselfishly give of our time and energy to help ourselves and others
                    better understand and care for the honeybee. We are involved in beekeeping on an individual, group,
                    state, national, and international level.</p>
