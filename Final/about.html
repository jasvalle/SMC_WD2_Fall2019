                <h2 class="about-title">Our Begining</h2>
                <p>On Saturday, August 18, 1873, the nine founding members of the Los Angeles County Beekeepers
                    Association
                    held its first meeting in El Monte, California.
                </p>
                <p>The Los Angeles County Beekeepers Association
                    has
                    met continuously since then. When Robert's Rules of Order were published in 1876 as a "guide to fair
                    and
                    orderly procedures in meetings" they were adopted by the LACBA.</p>

            <div class="about-container-1">
                <h2 class="about-title">Our Mission</h2>
                <p> To promote the interest of bee culture and beekeeping within Los Angeles County.</p>

                <p>To enhance the education of the general public and of the association members concerning the
                    important
                    roles of honeybees in the natural, rural, and urban worlds.</p>

                <p>To provide information for the closer cooperation of beekeepers with apiculture researchers and
                    public
                    agencies that they may work together for the promotion of systematic, managed beekeeping in the
                    County
                    of Los Angeles.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="about-title">Our Comunity</h2>
            <p>We are a diverse community populated by individuals from all walks of life. We are brought together
                by our interest in and love of the honeybee. We're composed of bee hobbyists, bee enthusiasts, small
                scale beekeepers, and commercial beekeepers who make our living from working with bees. Whether a
                new bee or a long time beekeeper we share our experience and knowledge with each other and the
                general public. Our members unselfishly give of our time and energy to help ourselves and others
                better understand and care for the honeybee. We are involved in beekeeping on an individual, group,
                state, national, and international level.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">

            <h2 class="about-title">What We Do</h2>
            <p>Presentations at our monthly meetings cover basic beekeeping throughout the seasons: bee habits,
                forage, hive maintenance, and how to test for pests that are harmful to bees. You’ll learn about
                using bee products and their benefits. You’ll see demonstrations on extracting honey and rendering
                beeswax, you’ll learn how bees make honey, and mead making. We’re informed about the latest honey
                bee research and changes in legislation affecting bees. </p>
            <p>As LACBA members we have the honor, privilege, and responsibility to help educate people of all
                ages on the important role honeybees play in our lives. Our members volunteer to speak at events
                like the Los Angeles County Fair Bee Booth and AgDayLA. The LACBA promotes the interest of bee
                culture and beekeeping within L.A. County through education of the public.</p>
