            <h2>Pollinator Friendly Plantings Along Roads and Highways</h2>
            <h4>December 02, 2019</h4>
            <h3>U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works</h3>
            <h3>November 20, 2019:</h3>
            <p>Carper, Merkley, Alexander, Rounds Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Create Monarch and Pollinator
                Highways
            </p>
            <p><em>The Bill would help revive monarch and pollinator habitat at a time when the population of
                    pollinators—critical to American agriculture—has dangerously declined</p></em></p>
            <p>WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works
                Committee, joined U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Mike Rounds
                (R-S.D.) today to introduce new legislation to help states create pollinator-friendly habitats along
                roads and highways. This legislation would help address the steep decline of pollinator populations,
                which poses a serious threat to Delaware farmers and the American food supply.</p>
            <p>Specifically, the Monarch and Pollinator Highway (MPH) Act of 2019 would establish a federal grant
                program available to state departments of transportation and Indian tribes to carry out
                pollinator-friendly practices on roadsides and highway rights-of-way.</p>
            <p><em>“Monarch butterflies and other pollinators serve an indispensable role in our natural ecosystems, and
                    their population decline poses a profound threat to both American food supply and to the economic
                    success of farmers in Delaware and throughout the country,”</em> said Senator Carper. <em>“Through
                    the use of competitive grants and assistance to communities, this bipartisan bill will take
                    meaningful, innovative steps towards building up pollinator habitats along our nation’s roads and
                    highways – helping our natural environment and our nation’s agricultural industry at the same time.
                    I want to thank Senators Merkley, Alexander and Rounds for their leadership on this urgent
                    issue.”</em></p>
            <p><em>“As monarch and honeybee populations decline precipitously, we don’t just risk losing these beautiful
                    creatures—we also face an existential threat to American agriculture and our food supply,”</em> said
                Senator Merkley. <em>“Every state already contains thousands of miles of green space around roads and
                    highways. If we transformed just a fraction of this land back to natural pollinator habitat, we
                    could make a real difference to pollinator populations. This is a bipartisan, common-sense idea that
                    the Senate should adopt without delay.”</em></p>
            <p><em>“Pollinators, especially bees, are vital to creating and maintaining the habitats and ecosystems that
                    we rely on to produce our food. This bill will help states promote highway beautification and
                    preservation of these pollinator habitats along roadways,”</em> said Senator Alexander. <em>“The
                    Tennessee Department of Transportation’s Pollinator Habitat Program is one of the nation’s best
                    state efforts in building and maintaining pollinator habitats along all of its state-maintained
                    roadways. If this legislation were to become law, the Tennessee Department of Transportation could
                    apply for federal funding to continue expanding their Pollinator Habitat Program.”</em></p>
            <p><em>“Bees play a vital role in making sure food gets on our table, acting as pollinators for
                    approximately
                    one-third of all agricultural products in the U.S. Our legislation seeks to use innovation and
                    targeted
                    conservation practices to protect and improve bees’ natural habitat so they can continue to provide
                    this
                    essential service and make certain future generations of crops and plants are produced,”</em> said
                Senator
                Rounds.</p>
            <p><em>“With so much of our natural landscape lost the millions of acres of roadsides across the US have
                    become
                    increasingly important as pollinator habitat,”</em> said Scott Black, Executive Director of the
                Xerces
                Society for Invertebrate Conservation. <em>“The Xerces Society is excited to support the Monarch and
                    Pollinator Highway (MPH) Act of 2019 which will provide much needed funding for states to maximize
                    habitat management and restoration for these vital animals.”</em></p>
            <p><em>“Pollinators are in great peril, with populations that have dropped precipitously in recent decades.
                    Protecting pollinator habitat along roadways is one helpful step in combating this rapid decline of
                    bees
                    and butterflies,”</em> said Jason Davidson, Food and Agriculture Campaigner at Friends of the Earth.
            </p>
            <p>MPH Act grants could be used for:</p>
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>The planting and seeding of native, locally-appropriate grasses, wildflowers, and milkweed;</li>
                <li>Mowing strategies that promote early successional vegetation and limit disturbance during periods of
                    highest use by target pollinator species;</li>
                <li>Implementation of an integrated vegetation management approach to address weed and pest issues;</li>
                <li>Removing nonnative grasses from planting and seeding mixes except for use as nurse or cover crops;
                    or</li>
                <li>Any other pollinator-friendly practices the Secretary of Transportation determines will be eligible.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The bill also requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to help states develop best practices
                around pollinator-friendly roads and highways. The bill would require DOT to develop and make available
                to state departments of transportation a prioritization ranking of pollinator-friendly practices on
                roadsides and highway rights-of-way, and to provide technical assistance to states that request it.</p>
            <p>The MPH Act comes as the population of monarch butterflies, honeybees, and other pollinators face
                dangerous declines. Western U.S. monarch populations hit a record low in 2018, with one researcher
                <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/science/monarch-butterfly-california.html"> the drop as
                    “potentially catastrophic.”</a> The honeybee population has also seen dramatic
                declines in recent years, with a 40% year-over-year decline between 2018 and 2019, and one expert
                describing <a
                    href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/40-decline-honey-bee-population-winter-unsustainable-experts/story?id=64191609">
                    repeated year-over-year losses as “unsustainably high.”</a> The U.S. Department of Agriculture
                estimates that <a
                    href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/plantsanimals/pollinate/">approximately
                    35% of the world’s food</a> crops depend on pollinators for survival.</p>
