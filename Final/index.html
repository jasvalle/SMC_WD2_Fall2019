            <h1 class="LACBA">LA County Beekeepers Association</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the Los Angeles County Beekeepers Association, founded in 1873, to foster the interest of bee
                culture and beekeeping within Los Angeles County. Our primary purpose is the care and welfare of the
                honeybee. Our group membership is composed of commercial and small scale beekeepers, bee hobbyists, and
                bee
                enthusiasts. So whether you came upon our site by design or just 'happened' to find us - we're glad
                you're
                here! Our club and this website are dedicated to educating our members and the general public. We
                support
                honeybee research, and adhering to best management practices for the keeping of bees.</p>
            <h2>Educate, Inform, Promote!</h2>
            <h3 class="main-h3">Bee Keeping Classes</h3>
            <p class="main-page">LACBA Beekeeping Class 101 is held out in the field where experienced members
                demonstrate the proper use of equipment, hive management, and tests for pests harmful to bees. We take
                you through a season of beekeeping, from February through October (excluding September), where you learn
                to look at what’s going on in your hive, how to identify problems, and care for your bees. <a

            <h3 class="main-h3">Educational Outreach:</h3>
            <p class="main-page">
                As LACBA members we have the honor, privilege, and responsibility to help educate people of all ages on
                the
                important role honeybees play in our lives. Our members volunteer to speak at events like the Los
                Angeles
                County Fair Bee Booth and AgDayLA. The LACBA promotes the interest of bee culture and beekeeping within
                L.A.
                County through education of the public.</p>

            <h3 class="main-h3">LA County Fair - Bee Booth</h3>

            <p class="main-page"> The LA County Fair is one of the largest county fairs in the country and the
                most-visited event in the
                Los Angeles region in September. It's an end-of-summer tradition for many. </p>

            <p>One of the most popular exhibits at the fair is the Bee Booth, and the highlight of the Bee Booth is the
                LACBA Observation Hive. During the week, thousands of school children visit the Bee Booth, excited to
                “Find
                the Queen” and marvel at the “Waggle Dance.”</p>

            <p>Fair goers of all ages get a chance to interact with experienced beekeepers, ask questions, and learn
                about bees.</p>

            <h3 class="main-h3">Funding Research:</h3>
            <p class="main-page">
                Money raised from our membership dues, fund raising efforts, and events, support ongoing honeybee
                research. Each year the LACBA contributes to the California State Beekeepers Association Research Fund
                which awards grants to multiple bee related projects and to other education and research entities. </p>

                north and south, and all the way across from the snowy Sierra to the ocean.” </p>
