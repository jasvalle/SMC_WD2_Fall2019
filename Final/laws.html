            <h2>CSU Bee Campus Featured at the 2019 LACBA Holiday Dinner</h2>
            <h4>November 20, 2019</h4>
            <p class="para-small">Feature Presentation by CSU Bee Campus
                2019 LACBA Annual Holiday Dinner
                at the Beautiful Pickwick Gardens!</p>
            <p>The Bee Campus USA program - part of Bee City USA* - fosters dialogue to raise awareness about the role
                of pollinators by endorsing a set of commitments for campuses to create sustainable habitats for all
                pollinating species, who are vital to feeding our planet. The primary goals of the Bee Campus USA
                program are to raise awareness, enhance pollinator habitats, and celebrate campus achievements.</p>
            <h3>Why protect pollinators?</h3>
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>1 in every 3 bites of food we eat is the direct product of insect pollination</li>
                <li>90% of all wild plants and trees rely on pollinators for the survival of their species</li>
                <li>Since “Colony Collapse Disorder” began in 2007, which resulted in the disappearance of thousands of
                    honey bee colonies, multiple other pollinator species have begun to disappear or significantly
                    decline</li>
                <li>Honey bee populations are declining at a growing annual rate of 44%</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What's the buzz at CSUCI?</h3>
            <p>The CSU Channel Islands (CI) campus is nestled in the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountain Range in
                Ventura County, California. We are located on the Oxnard Plain, which has rich soils, a favorable
                climate and a long growing season, making it a “hotspot” for agriculture. Our staple crops include
                strawberries and citrus – both of which are heavily dependent on the pollination services of our native
                insects and non-native honeybees.</p>
            <h3>Bee Campus USA</h3>
            <p class="para-small">As of September 6th, 2018, CSU Channel Islands is the FIRST university in California
                to receive the esteemed recognition of being an official Bee Campus USA!</p>
            <p>Not only are we the first in the CSU system to receive this honor, but we are the first 4-year university
                in the state of California. This recognition signifies that CSUCI is among the 51 most
                pollinator-friendly campuses in the entire nation. </p>
            <p>The Bee Campus USA recognition, created and enforced by Bee City USA: An Initiative of the Xerces
                Society, requires that seven guidelines be met by each participating institution. For more information
                about how our campus has reached these goals and beyond, please visit our official Bee Campus webpage.
