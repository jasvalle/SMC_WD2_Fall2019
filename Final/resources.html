            <h2>Bee Removal Services</h2>
            <h3>THE LACBA DOES NOT PROVIDE BEE/SWARM REMOVAL SERVICES.
                PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE LACBA FOR BEE/SWARM REMOVALS.
                PLEASE CONTACT THE BEEKEEPER DIRECTLY. THANK YOU!</h3>
            <p>If you find a swarm (cluster, ball or bunch) of bees on your property, don't panic. Don't grab a can of
                Bee and Wasp Control and spray them. And don't call an exterminator. Call a Beekeeper!</p>

            <p> The LACBA does not endorse or recommend any specific bee removal companies. We do provide the following
                referral list of LACBA Club Sponsor Members who are experienced beekeepers with knowledge and expertise
                in bee/swarm removals.</p>

            <p>
                Swarming bees are not usually aggressive. They’re looking for a new home. A responsible beekeeper will
                try to save the hive whenever possible, relocate it, and if there are signs it is an aggressive hive,
                (re-queen it) or destroy the hive. Removing a swarm from a structure is a much more difficult task than
                capturing colonies from trees or bushes. If bees have taken up residence in a building it may need to be
                opened to retrieve the bees, the comb, and the honey. Read your contract as to what your and the
                beekeeper’s contractual obligations are. These beekeepers may not be licensed contractors and may choose
                to not take on hazardous removals. If the swarm is hanging from high voltage lines call your local
                electric company.

            </p>
            Most beekeepers charge for their services (which may just be to cover their time and costs). Cost varies
            depending on the job. The LACBA DOES NOT have a list of bee removal charges. You need to call the
            beekeeper directly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make sure you contact a beekeeper who serves the area where the bees are located. We appreciate your
                contacting a beekeeper for bee/swarm removal and request that you be respectful of these beekeepers.
                They are sometimes overwhelmed with the amount of requests they receive for removals and are also busy
                caring for their bees. Thank you!</p>
